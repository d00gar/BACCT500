* This lesson revisits probability notions most germane to data analysts.   
*
* The science of probability facilitates the study of the flavors of chance.  As
* you might imagine, this is a vast field of inquiry.  In this module we will 
* only examine some of the basic ideas of "chance" "experiment," "event," and
* link them to numerical measures such as "frequency" and "probability."

*  Consider the chance of 
*   - a "fair coin" coming up heads
*   - drawing a black ball from a basket of 100 balls, 50 black, rest white
*   - drawing a black ball from a basket of 100 balls, 90 black, rest white
*   - drawing a black ball from a basket of 100 balls, 10 black, rest white
*   - drawing three black balls in five draws from a basket of 100 balls
*     > 50 black, rest white 
*     > 90 black, rest white 
*     > 10 black, rest white 
*  Each of these outcomes (heads or tails, black ball or white ball) would be
*   called an "event" and the process of tossing the coin or drawing a ball be
*   called an "experiment" ... 
 
*   - drawing more than two black balls in five draws from a basket of 100 balls
*     > 50 black, rest white 
*     > 90 black, rest white 
*     > 10 black, rest white
